# About Triton

Triton is a dotfile management tool made for use in combination with GNU Stow. It was made to solve two problems:
  1) User interest in easily switching between configuration files for only certain GROUPS of applications (EG, alternate ricing setups)
  2) Users may be interested in using the same dotfiles across different machines, but some settings within config files may be machine-specific
